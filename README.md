# Siete-Y-Medio
This was mostly practice with git, but the game is played like Blackjack, though the player is trying to reach 7.5 instead of 21
with a different set of cards from a standard deck of 52 cards. Siete y medio uses a "Spanish Baraja" with 4 suits like a Blackjack
deck, but has values of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11 and 12. The 10, 11 and 12 all take on the values of .5 for the purposes of this game.

The base of this project was taken from Salazar's example files.
